High-Level Tech & UI Suggestions
Component Library

Keep using ChakraUI for rapid styling and theming.

Use Recharts or Visx for interactive charts.

State Management

For a mid-sized app, React Context + local state is fine.

If it grows complex, consider Zustand or Redux Toolkit.

Data Layer

You already have Supabase‚Äîkeep functions for fetching accounts, txns, goals, budgets, bills.

Normalize shape in context or a store so every screen can share data.

Routing

On web: React Router v6 for /dashboard, /account/:id, /settings

On React Native: React Navigation with a bottom-tab navigator.

UX polish

Add skeleton loaders for each card while data is fetching.

Maintain consistent spacing and typography across screens.

Ensure accessibility: labels on icons, sufficient contrast.
